# Hello_World
My first repository
This is my first foray into github. I've used the version management tool IBM RTC, which is similar to this, so I'm not completely lost, just mostly.
I'm doing this because I have a job inteview in a few days and I need to use github, C# and .NET Framework, which are all new to me. 
Mate! Bring me my brown pants!
